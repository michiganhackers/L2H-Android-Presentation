## Improving the To-do List App
If you're interested in expanding upon the demo app, or you just want some ideas for creating an app of your own, refer to the following feature list. The list is roughly ordered in increasing difficulty.

* Support reordering of items e.g. drag and drop
	* Hint: For drag and drop, learn about the RecyclerView and ItemTouchHelper classes
